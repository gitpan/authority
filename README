NAME
    authority - loads a module only if it has a particular authority

SYNOPSIS
     use authority 'cpan:STEVAN', Moose => qw();
     use authority 'cpan:TOBYINK', HTML::HTML5::Builder => qw(:standard);

DESCRIPTION
    This pragma allows you to indicate that you wish to load a module only if
    its authority is a particular URI.

    Using this pragma automatically enables UNIVERSAL::AUTHORITY.

    `use authority $authority, $module, @arguments`
        Require and import the module at compile time. This is the usual mode
        of operation.

    `authority->import($authority, $module, @arguments)`
        Require and import the module at run time.

    Note that the special $authority value "Any", indicates that any authority
    is allowed (including undef).

    Experimentally, $module may contain a module name and minimum version,
    separated with a space.

    There is also a very experimental feature allowing releases of the same
    package by different authorities to live side-by-side, though only one of
    them can be required into a running script.

    In this case, assuming that the inc path is `/opt/perl/lib` and a script
    does this:

     use authority 'cpan:JOE', My::Module => qw();

    Then Perl will attempt to load `/opt/perl/lib/cpan_3A_JOE/My/Module.pm`
    before it tries the usual `/opt/perl/lib/My/Module.pm`.

    This is not anywhere near as powerful as the authority feature of Perl 6,
    but it's a start.
